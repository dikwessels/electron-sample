# Electron Sample.app

:no_entry_sign: this is a work in progress. It will change. Don't use it yet.

This is a sample app

```bash
npm install # to install electron dependencies
./script/bootstrap
```

Then you can run it. This will run the app in development mode.

```
./script/run
```

And when you're ready to build for release run:

```
./script/build
```
